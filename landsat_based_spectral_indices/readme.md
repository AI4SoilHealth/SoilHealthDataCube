### Landsat-based Spectral Indices Data Cube

Time-series of Landsat-based spectral indices for continental Europe for 2000--2022 to support soil health monitoring. This data cube is available at 30~m resolution, with bimonthly, annual and long-term analyzes throughout continental Europe, including Ukraine, the UK, and Turkey, covering 2000 to 2022. Focus was on indices of importance for monitoring soil health: 
- **vegetation index**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR).
- **soil exposure**: Bare Soil Index (BSI) and Bare Soil Fraction (BSF).
- **tillage and soil sealing**: Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) and minimum Normalized Difference Tillage Index (minNDTI).
- **crop patterns**: Number of Seasons (NOS) and Crop Duration Ratio (CDR).
- **water dynamics**: Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)

This data cube could serve not only for direct monitoring, analysis, and verification of specific aspects of soil health but also as important input for modeling and mapping soil properties

Preliminary maps of annual indices in year 2022 and long-term trend maps are available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10776891). All the maps are aligned with the standard spatial/temporal resolution and sizes indicated/recomended by AI4SoilHealth project, Work Package - 5.

## Funding and purpose

The production of these land masks are funded by [AI4SoilHealth](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101086179). These land masks are created as a reference of the data cubes that will be produced within the frame of [AI4SoilHealth](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101086179).

## Disclaimer
If you spot any problems in the maps, or see any possible improvements in them, or see any potential collaborations, or etc..., just raise an issue [here](https://github.com/AI4SoilHealth/SoilHealthDataCube/issues) or send us emails! We appreciate any feedbacks/helps that could refine them.
