### Pan-EU Landmask

## Summary

The files in this folder are used to produce 3 Pan EU landmasks:

1. Jupyter notebook used to produce tile products:
   - **Land mask**: with values differentiating land, ocean, and inland water
   - **NUT-3 code map**: with values differentiating administrative area at nut-3 level
   - **ISO-3166 country code map**: with values differentiating countries according to ISO-3166 standard
2. Bash files that are used to merge tiles, reproject crs, resample to another resolution.

All the landmasks are aligned with the standard spatial/temporal resolution and sizes indicated/recomended by AI4SoilHealth project, Work Package - 5. The coverage of these maps closely match the data coverage of https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european i.e. the official selection of countries listed here: https://lanEEA39d.copernicus.eu/portal_vocabularies/geotags/eea39. 

## Funding and purpose

The production of these land masks are funded by [AI4SoilHealth](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101086179). These land masks are created as a reference of the data cubes that will be produced within the frame of [AI4SoilHealth](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101086179).

## Contacts

These masks are created by [Xuemeng](xuemeng.tian@opengeohub.org), [Yu-Feng](yu-feng.ho@opengeohub.org), and [Martijn](martijn.witjes@opengeohub.org) from [OpenGeoHub](https://opengeohub.org/).

If you spot any problems in the land masks, or see any possible improvements in them, or have any questions, or etc..., just send us emails! We appreciate any feedbacks/helps that could refine these masks.
